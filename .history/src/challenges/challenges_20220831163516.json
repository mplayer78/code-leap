        "description": "When he woke up Sam discovered that he had materialised into the body of a sailor on an old schooner. In front of him was a wooden chest and sam suspected that the answer to him getting home may be inside the chest. When he went to open it, though, he realised that there were 2 combination locks.\n He asked one of the sailors wether they knew the combination but the sailor said\n\"No one can remember the combination for the lock. To remind ourselves we tallied the two numbers and that total was %target% but we can't remember the two original numbers\"\nUpon looking at the lock you see the numbers on the wheels of the combination locks. The numbers are shown below. Input the numbers into the boxes below to see if you can open the box.",
